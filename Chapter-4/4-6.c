/*The total distance travelled by a vehicle in t seconds is given by 
    distance = ut + (a(pow(t,2)))/2
Where u is the initial velocity (metres per second), a is the acceleration (metres per second square). Write a program to evaluate the distance travelled at regular intervals of time, given the values of u and a. The program should provide the flexibility to the user to select his own time intervals and repeat the calculations for different values of u and a.*/
